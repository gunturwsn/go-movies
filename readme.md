<h2>Go-Movies</h2>

This is a Golang CRUD project with a movie as the object sourced from freeCodeCamp.

To run it, you can build <pre>go build</pre>
or running

<pre>go run main.go</pre>

if you just want to run the application.
When you are doing a build and an error occurs

<code>go: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see 'go help modules'</code>

You can run this command

<pre>go env -w GO111MODULE=off</pre>

Thank you and Happy Coding!
